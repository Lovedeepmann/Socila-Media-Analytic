. Conclusion
• We used the tweepy and fetch the data from the twitter
explored the data in different ways.
• We prepared the text data of tweets by removing the 
unnecessary things.
• We trained the model based on machine learning 
model and on TensorFlow with all settings 
• We evaluated the model with different evaluation 
measures
• We compare the mobile network using the Bar graph 
and pie char
